# graphit

graphIT is a utility built upon matplotlib for creating a large amount of custom graphs. 

### why use this over matplotlib? 

matplotlib is an extremely powerful utility, however in my opinion it is definitely catered to developers. graphIT is designed to be accessable to anyone with basic experience with spreadsheeting software. 

# example usage

CLI: 

```bash 
graphit --xlsx mydata.xlsx --config myconfig.json --output-dir ~/mygraphs
```
